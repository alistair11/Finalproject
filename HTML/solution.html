                      We live in a world where food waste is a big concern. According to statistics ⅓ of the
                       food in the world was wasted or lost every year.

                    <h2>Our Solution </h2>
                    <p>
                      This is exactly why our app will solve and help to reduce these numbers. Our app “FoodCalc - Eat
                      more, waste less” will prevent people from throwing away ingredients and food that still can be used
                      to make different meals. FoodCalc helps the user by calculating all of the ingredients and find the most
                       fitting meals with
                       the highest match rate. By using this feature the user will throw less food in the bin or buy new
                       ingredients because of spoilage.
