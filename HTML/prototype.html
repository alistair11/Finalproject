      <h1>What is inside of your fridge?</h1>
      <p class="text-flex2">Start by selecting ingredients that you already
        have at home from several categories (such as meat, seasoning and dairy-products) and simply press the "Calculate" button.
        In fact, the app lets you list ingredients to include or omit in recipe results.
        That way, if you don’t have potatoes in the fridge, the app will tell the user that potatoes is the only missing ingredient, which makes it easier for the user to only buy ingredients that is missing. Because of this the user does not buy unnecessary food ingredients which gets wasted later.
