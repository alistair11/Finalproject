                <p>  In 2017 over 385 000 tons of edible food were wasted in Norway, which makes it 73kg food wasted by each citizen. Out of these 73 kilograms about 42,6 kilograms were edible food from their homes. 60% of our food waste are expired food. That's why we need to find a solution on how we can make people use their food before it expires.</p>

             <p> 25% of all food that is produced and traded ends up as waste.   The amount of food that ends up as waste in Norway every year, could feed as much as 5 million people every year.

            On a global basis we throw out over 1,3 billion tons of food in the trash. If we manage to use 25% of the worlds yearly food waste, we can feed around 870 million people according to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization).
            If we collect all food waste in the world and look at it as an own nation, this nation would be the third highest greenhouse gas emitting nation (after China and the US).

            If we just could find a way to reduce the amount of food waste in the world, we could at the same time contribute to help the environment.</p>
